# 500-Hours-of-ML

This repository is to provide material to learn machine learning as well as deep learning from scratch. If you follow this repository sequentially and commit 3 hours daily, then I assure that you will be proficient in machine learning as well as deep learning concepts in 6 months. The complete material is not uploaded yet, it will be done by mid february.

I have created this repository to upload my ML notes. These notes includes Python - basic and advanced (OOPs), Maths - linear algebra, probability and statistics, libraries - numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn, data preprocessing, ML algorithms - regression, classification, unsupervised, deep learning - ANN, CNN, RNN and much more. Here I'm uploading my updated notes by the time. After following this repository you will be clear of all concetps of ML and their applications. I have not mentioned project ideas here, I hope you will find them by your own. To get best out of this repository follow the steps below : 

1. Read the topic from table of contents
2. Learn and explore from all resources mentioned in this repository and beyond that also
3. Code it on 3-5 datasets
4. Make your own notes
5. Come to this repository and update your notes

ML is not difficult to learn, but it requires consistency.
