# 500-Hours-of-ML

This repository is to provide material to learn machine learning as well as deep learning from scratch. If you follow this repository and commit 3 hours daily, then I assure that you will be proficient in machine learning as well as in deep learning concepts in 6 months. I have created this repository to provide my ML notes. It includes all aspects of machine learning. In this repository I have povided material required for ML, you can explore beyond that.

This repository includes, Python - basic to advanced including OOPs concepts, Maths - linear algebra, probability & statistics, workbook for important libraries - numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, ML concepts - regression, classification, clustering, recommendation, DL concepts - ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, unsupervised learning and much more. This repository provides the final notes of topics, If you are encountering a topic first time then this repository is not for you. Below are the steps to get best from this repository.

1. Read the topic from table of contents
2. Learn it from all the resources mentioned in introduction folder, also explore beyond that.
3. Go through official documentation, and implement the algorithm on 3-5 datasets.
4. Make your own notes.
5. Come to this repository and update your notes.

After commiting 500 hours, you will be able to get atlest an internship in ML. I have mentioned project ideas also in this repository.

Right now, I'm updating my notes and uploading here day by day. So within 1 month, my complete notes will be uploaded here.
